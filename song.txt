No time for rest
No pillow for my head
Nowhere to run from this
No way to forget
Around the shadows creep
Like friends they cover me
Just wanna lay me down and finally try to get some sleep
We carry on through the storm
Tired soldiers in this war
Remember what we're fighting for

Meet me on the battlefield
Even on the darkest night
I will be your sword and shield,
Your camouflage and you will be mine
Echoes and the shots ring out
We may be the first to fall
Everything could stay the same,
Or we could change it all
Meet me on the battlefield
